# Clonk Experiments

This repository contains various experimental mods for the Clonk game series.

## Experiments

### DM Factory (Bullet time)

Factory (Bullet time) is a Hazard experiment based on the Forsak IV map. It supports a Cobalt-like local bullet time for shots fire between players. Unfortunately it is quite complex to also slow objects and Clonk, but I might add this at a later point.
